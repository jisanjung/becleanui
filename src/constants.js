        question: 'What is a ceramic coating?',
        answer: `Simple put, a ceramic coating is the best way to provide long-lasting protection while maximizing the appearance of your car. 
        Unlike traditional waxes, our ceramic coatings can last for 3+ years and do not need to be regularly applied. 
        This not only saves you the trouble of having to reapply a traditional wax, 
        it also saves you money since you would not need to continually see a professional detailer every 6 months when the wax breaks down.`,
